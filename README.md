# GHDL Build under Windows

This repository contains automation scripts to build [GHDL](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl) and the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl-language-server) for Windows.

**Everything in this repository is currently WIP**

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/MaximilianKoestler/ghdl-build/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild) are set up to autmatically run the scripts.

Later, they will also bundle the releases.
